The Lord is One and He can be attained through the grace of the true Guru.
The Lord is One and the victory is of the Lord.
JAP JI SAHIB.
The sacred utterance of The Tenth Sovereign:
CHHAPAI STANZA. BY THY GRACE
He who is without mark or sign, He who is without caste or line.
He who is without colour or form, and without any distinctive norm.
He who is without limit and motion, All effulgence, non-descript Ocean.
